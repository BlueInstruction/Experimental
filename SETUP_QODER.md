# SETUP_QODER.md

This repository uses the QoderAI GitHub Action (QoderAI/qoder-action). The workflow failed because the Qoder GitHub App and the required secret were not configured. Follow the steps below to complete the setup.

Prerequisites
- GitHub account with admin access to this repository.
- (Optional) GitHub CLI (gh) installed to manage secrets from the command line.
- Qoder CLI (optional, recommended) or the repository-provided setup script.

Steps

1) Install the Qoder CLI (optional but recommended)

- See the Qoder docs for installation instructions: https://docs.qoder.com/cli/qoder-action
- Example (macOS/Linux with npm-installed CLI):
  npm install -g @qoder/cli

2) Run the guided GitHub setup

- In your terminal run (if using Qoder CLI):
  qoder setup-github

- If the repository includes a setup script named `setup-github`, run it from the repo root:
  ./setup-github

The guided setup will:
- Connect your Qoder account to GitHub.
- Prompt you to install the Qoder GitHub App (qoderai) on this repository.
- Provide or generate a personal access token (PAT) for use by the GitHub Action.

3) Install the Qoder GitHub App

- On GitHub: Settings → Installed GitHub Apps (or https://github.com/settings/installations)
- Find the Qoder (QoderAI / qoderai) app and install it for the BlueInstruction/Experimental repository.
- Grant the app the requested repository permissions (pull-requests, contents, actions as required).

4) Add the repository secret

- Create a repository secret named `QODER_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` with the token produced by the setup step.

Using the GitHub UI:
- Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret
- Name: QODER_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN
- Value: (paste the token)

Using GitHub CLI:
- gh secret set QODER_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN --repo BlueInstruction/Experimental --body "$TOKEN"

5) Verify token scopes

- If you created a PAT manually, ensure it has the necessary scopes (at minimum: repo and workflow/actions scopes as required by Qoder docs). Prefer the token generated by the Qoder setup.

6) Re-run the workflow

- On GitHub go to Actions, open the failed run and Re-run jobs.
- If the error persists, collect logs and consult Qoder docs or open an issue with QoderAI/qoder-action.

Troubleshooting
- Ensure the Qoder app is installed on the exact repository (not only the organization).
- Confirm the secret name is exactly `QODER_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN`.
- If the guided setup fails, capture the output and check for network or permission problems.
